                    <p>The aim of this project was, in addition to an appealing design concept, to do justice to the
                        passion of bike couriers,
                        to develop a communication strategy that generates viewers and motivates and appreciates the
                        participants of the
                        competition. As part of this final project for graphic designer EFZ, a market analysis and
                        target group definition were
                        carried out in two intensive weeks in advance and documented in a 24-page dossier ↓ . Based on
                        this, a design concept
                        with various media was designed. The result with the previous achievements was rewarded for the
                        best graduation.</p>
