                    <p>We believe every company can perform better if its brand connects with people on an emotional
                        level.
                        A
                        brand that’s
                        emotive triggers feelings, inspires action, earns loyalty, and lifts spirits. In the overcrowded
                        business world, your
                        brand must resonate rationally and emotionally to cut through the noise. Never overlook the
                        mind,
                        but
                        always aim for the
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>These 50 feelings are a selection from 301 emotions we use to help our clients build successful
                        brands.
                        For each entry,
                        we have paired graphic design and animation with quotes from our team and influential thinkers.
                        The
                        result is a visual
                        metaphor that aims to not only illustrate the emotion, but bring it to life. As a whole, we hope
                        this
                        interactive
                        dictionary excites, ignites, and inspires you to view the world in a new way.</p>
